This is an individual homework assignment from COSC 2436. 
The input file contains the size of the hash table, probing type, and an integer list.
There will be either linear (c1 = 1) or quadratic probing (c1 = 3, c2 = 5).
We will insert the list of integers into the hash table.
After, we will implement the heap algorithm to create a min heap from the hash table elements.
We will print the hash table in the first line, then the min heap in the second line.
